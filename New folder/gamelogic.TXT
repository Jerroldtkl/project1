1.
create the logic of the game.
etc how its going to run.

-there will be 3 different difficulties with 2 game modes
simple mode & realisitic mode
easy/med/hard

-simple mode
the difference between the 3 difficulties is how fast the interval is between 
each spawn(circles), and how big the spawn radius is.
clicking the circles will explode them and generate points.
the circles will only spawn after the previous circle has been clicked.
there will be a 1 min timer and each time a circle is clicked = 1pt

-realistic mode
difference between difficulties is the same
the difference is the mouse is fixed onto center. moving it will move the
entire screen like a normal fps game.
same rules apply with the exception of if the shot taken is missed, 
it will add to the accuracy display. a 100% hit rate will display 100% accuracy
2/10 shots miss is an 80% accuracy
will display results at the end with the following
total shots fired
total points
accuracy
