explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

technologies
JS,HTML,CSS

approach taken
-mainly involved with usage of dom. (basically almost did my entire project with dom LUL)
-started with a single difficulty and expanded from there(again via dom)
-added some global function(actually just 2), couldnt create more cuz most of the stuffs are added via dom which makes it hard to use a global function
-added harder difficulties

-

problems faced
-spawning of circles to be within the desired box as well as having multiple functions interact
with each other within a function.

things to improve(currently no unsolved problems)
-to createa more divs within the html and just expand from there instead of using dom to make
a new div over and over
-this will allow me to create more global functions and have the function be more interactive
-explore more css methods and designs.
